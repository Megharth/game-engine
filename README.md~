# Game Engine

A base setup of a Game Engine using C++. This summarizes everything that I have learned in class CS5850 at Northeastern University. I have developed three games using the same engine and it can be found in their respective branches. All of these games are fairly optimized to run at 60 FPS and are integrated with Box2D Physics engine. Have implemented a resource manager, sound manager and physics manager as a part of the base of game engine to utilize the resource for the game efficiently. Contains Input manager to effectively register player's input and respond to that input with minimal lag. The engine is developed with component based system to divide the functionalities among various components and then use them as needed. 

The games are:

#### Breakout
  - A basic breakout game with 3 unique levels.
  - Offers 3 lives throughout the game.
  - Player needs to destroy each brick in the current level to go the next level.
  - Player loses a life if they miss to catch the ball with paddle.
  - Contains an engaging background music and sounds for different interactions throughout the game.
  - Can pause / unpause and reset game.
    
#### Skull Saga 
  - A "Mario" style platformer game in which you need to collect the collectibles to increase your score and reach to the goal.
